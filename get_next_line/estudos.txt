From up above I heard
The angels sing to me these words
And sometimes, in your eyes
I see the beauty of the world

Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes, eyes

Sometimes the stars decide
To reflect in puddles in the dirt
When I look in your eyes
I forget all about what hurts

Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
And cry

Believe in miracles

Oh hey, I'm floating up above the world now
Oh hey, I'm floating up above the world now

Oh yeah yeah yeah!
