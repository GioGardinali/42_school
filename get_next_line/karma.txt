You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrail, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

And I keep the side of my street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
But for you, it's not sweet like honey
Karma is a cat purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spider boy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know the cash ain't the only prize?
It's coming back around

And I keep the side of my street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
But for you, it's not sweet like honey
Karma is a cat purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask my why so many things, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma is on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me

'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma's a relaxing thought
But it's not for you, it's not sweet like honey
Karma is a cat purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a God (Ah)
Uh-huh, mm
Karma is a relaxing thought
